Learning Programming

Apr 10 - Got Medium membership
Apr 13 - Started Freecodecamp
Apr 18 - Stopped Freecodecamp at jQuery (step 89) because it rubbbed me the wrong way to learn these without context. Transitioning from writing notes on paper and then typing the code into the editor was pissing me off.
Apr 19 - Took a look at a lecture from MIT about math for computer programming, some very interesting things but I was sleep deprived so didn't absorb much. Regret not learning Emath better. 
Apr 20 - Finished the Week 0 Lecture and played around with Scratch. 
Apr 22 - Started illustrating for the Lunchtime for Noface game.
Apr 30 - Started figuring out the interactive bits on Scratch, realize the sizes were all off, need to be tweaked for the game.
May 2 - Finished game on Scratch, submitted to CS50. (read about blockchain)
